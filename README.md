Yes, windows, chrome and other things will complain that this is totally a virus because it's not "common". 

Just drag it to your taskbar and mash

# Season I: Into the Sands
The initial release / season. Buggy, unstable, and full of patch nights. The nomads is also using a tent mod that allows people to make their bases in mobile tents.

# Season II: Nightmare (June 1st or earlier)
The second season in Auram. Hopefully much more stable and less creeping with dupes
- Removed Divergent Underground (no longer will rocks drop instead of cobble, better ore digging etc)
- Removed Nomadic Tents
- Added Dimensional Doors instead
- You no longer start in Atum. You will now start in The Midnight, with new quest lines & fixes
- All mods require a quest unlock but they are easier if the mod is intended for early game
- Removed all progressions using RF/tick
- Removed True Prophecy from the world drop
