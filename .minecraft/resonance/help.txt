Depending on what the player is doing ingame, different triggers will activate and deactivate.
Multiple triggers can be active at once. When triggers change, the queue of music changes.
Below is a list of triggers that happen and their description.

=== TAG CONDITIONS ===
The json config contains all tags by default as separate conditions. If you assume the tag name is 'biome_plains'
biome_plains  = Condition met if the tag is active
!biome_plains = Condition is met if tag is INACTIVE
biome_*       = If any tag active starts with biome_ (such as bione_plains) or (biome_desert)
!biome_mesa*  = If any tag inactive starts with biome_mesa (such as bione_mesa) or (biome_mesa_rock)
